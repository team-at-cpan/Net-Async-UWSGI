Revision history for {{$dist->name}}

{{$NEXT}}
	No new features.

	Bugs fixed:
	* Write failure would warn(), replaced with debug_printf since this is
	common when clients disconnect partway through writing the response
	* Invalid JSON would throw an exception, this is now caught and reported
	via ->debug_printf only.
