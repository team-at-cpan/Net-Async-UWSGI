0.004     2014-12-30 12:15:18+00:00 Europe/London
	No new features.

	Test fixes:
	* Win32 fails due to missing functions in the Socket API, so attempt
	to prevent installation there via Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AssertOS.
	Haven't tested this on a windows system, just looking for a minimal-effort
	way to avoid spurious test failures here.

0.003     2014-12-28 19:04:10+00:00 Europe/London
	No new features.

	Bugs fixed:
	* Write failure would warn(), replaced with debug_printf since this is
	common when clients disconnect partway through writing the response
	* Invalid JSON would throw an exception, this is now caught and reported
	via ->debug_printf only.
